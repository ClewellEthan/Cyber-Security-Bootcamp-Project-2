In this slide I have broken down the network topology of the devices used to complete the engagement.

# Slide 5

This slide shows the results of my Nmap scan that was completed using this command: nmap -Pn -O 192.168.1.0/24

This slide is a description of the vulnerabilities that I uncovered in the engagement I used them to penetrate the victim machine, gain persistence on the victim machine and traverse the system. 
the tools used to complete the steps were: Hydra, MSFVENOM, Metasploit, Meterpreter 

# Slide 8

![SLIDE 8](/Slides/SLIDE8.png)

In this slide I depict using Hydra to Brute Force the login for the user "Ashton" because he was identified as a high level company official during my reconnaissance. Hydra was the tool of choice because I was attacking 
a web based file sharing site. The Hydra tool took about 15,000 password attempts before finding a match. 

# Slide 9

Once I gained access to the hidden file that required brute forcing in the previous step, I found that there was a vulnerable WebDAV server that was in use. I then used MSFVENOM to create a TCP Reverse shell PHP script and then
uploaded that on to the WebDAV server and executed the script to open a connection to my machine detailed in the next slide.  

# Slide 10

![SLIDE 10](/Slides/SLIDE10.png)

This slide details the connection that was opened by the TCP reverse shell exploit. Once I had a connection to the system I was able to traverse the system in any way I saw fit.

# Slide 12

The following slides will detail the "blue team" view of the attack. The victim machine was forwarding log data with Metricbeat, Filebeat, and Packetbeat to Kibana.

# Slide 13

![SLIDE 13](/Slides/SLIDE13.png)

This slide depicts the data that was generated by the port scan that was competed with Nmap. 

# Slide 14

![SLIDE 14](/Slides/SLIDE14.png)

While I was in the site doing reconnaissance I found a "Secret Folder" this shows that I was requesting the site and that I was able to find a file beyond the inital "GET" request that was made on the parent folder 

# Slide 15

![SLIDE 15](/Slides/SLIDE15.png)

As mentioned before I used Hydra to brute force the login to the secret folder, this is the evidence of the tool requesting the folder for password attempts.  

# Slide 16

![SLIDE 16](/Slides/SLIDE16.png)

This slide depicts the WebDAV connection and the accessed files that were on the server

# Slide 17

![SLIDE 17](/Slides/SLIDE17.png)

The remaining slides detail ways to mitigate the attack and harden the system, The Miter Att&ck frame work was used to detail the mitigations.
