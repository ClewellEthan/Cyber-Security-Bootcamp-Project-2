# Cyber-Security-Bootcamp-Project-2
Second of Three Projects completed during my bootcamp 

In this project we were using a Windows based VM that had remote connections to a headless server, an ELK stack and a KALI-Linux machine. The headless server was the victim machine and the KALI-Linux machine was the attacking machine. 

We were tasked with preforming reconnaissance with Nmap to find weaknesses in the network, Once we uncovered the weakness we were tasked with accessign a hidden file on a WebDAV server and uploading a TCP Reverse Shell exploit to the WebDAV to traverse the file structure to find a hidden file. Once we found he file we used Kibana to depict the attack data and explain ways to protect against future attacks using this data. The Miter ATT&CK Frame work was used to explain the attack and to explain mitgation tactics  

Inside you will find a slide show broken down into the different slides and further explainations made where necessary.
